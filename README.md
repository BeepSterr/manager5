Good luck with trying to get this to work, I Know probably couldn't.
You'll need a NodeJS, Twice actually. A MySQL Server and some accounts/api's

### Requirements
This list is most likely very incomplete, but you'll need these for sure
- NodeJS
- NodeJS (Yes, Again)
- MySQL
- Some form of proxy

### Api/Service requirements
these are api's & other things you'll need to get shit to work properly
- Google cloud Storage (Sticker storage)
- SafeSearch API V3 (Malware/Phishing link AutoMod)
- Some other BS probably

### Setup Guide
1. Good luck
2. May god have mercy on your soul.

In actually, Main things are in the config.json's and some of the bot modules, web should work if the database is correct. Probably.
Oh yeah, You'll also need to rip out the awooUploader and replace it with your own. Probably your best bet would be to use the thing that powers stickers. once again, Good luck.
